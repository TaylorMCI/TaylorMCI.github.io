Pokemon's creator, Game Freak, started off just being a simple gaming magazine company. In 1996 they made their first Pokemon games, Pokemon Red and Green. When the games came to America they got Red and Blue, being updated versions of the orginal Red and Green. As the years went on more and more games were being made. There are now series such as Pokemon Ranger, and Mystery Dungeon.
